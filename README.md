FCS Status Board
================

If anyone wants to fork the repo and do these, be my guest.

- Fade out passed class, make text smaller
- FCS logo instead of name
- Constant header/footer, dynamic middle (vert height)
- Scrolling announcements in footer
- Figure out season based on current date for color scheme
- Highlight background of current class
- Talk to alex nichol about finding which letter day it is
- Adjust current class calculation so it ends 1 minute before (10:59 for last block vs. 11:00 for next) [this only makes sense to me, ignore it Grant and Colin] lol
- Weather isn't accurate, change the API (Yahoo weather?)
- Weather effects
